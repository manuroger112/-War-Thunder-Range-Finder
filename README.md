# WarThunder-RangeFinder
A simple range finder for war thunder made using tkinter in Python

It can be dead on target but unfortunately the further the distance of calculation, the more sensitive the program becomes with the data set for grid px size causing range to variate between many meters (around 40-50~M +/- at 1200M range)
Best recommendation is to really pay attention while setting the grid size in pixels (Normal Unit)
